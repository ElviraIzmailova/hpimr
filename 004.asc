//A/N: As others have noted, the novels seem inconsistent in the apparent
//purchasing power of a Galleon; I’m picking a consistent value and sticking with
//it. Five pounds sterling to the Galleon doesn’t square with seven Galleons for
//a wand and children using hand-me-down wands.

//Harry stood there, and stared with his mouth open at the family vault. He had
//so many questions he didn’t know __where__ to start.
Гаррі стояв і витріщався з відкритим ротом на родинне сховище. У нього було
стільки питань, що він не знав з __чого__ почати.

// 237
//From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagall watched him,
//seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her eyes intent. Well, that made
//sense. Being plopped in front of a giant heap of gold coins was a test of
//character so pure it was archetypal.
Ледве з-за дверей до сховища професорка Макґонеґел спостерігала за ним, нібито
безтурботно сперлася на стіну, проте її очі були уважними. Ну, це доволі
зрозуміло.  Опинитися поряд з величезною купою золота -- це просто архетип
випробовування характеру.

// 238
//“Are these coins the pure metal?” Harry said finally.
-- Ці монети з щирого металу? -- нарешті сказав Гаррі.

// 239
//“What?” hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near the door. “Are you
//questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres?”
-- Що? -- прошипів ґоблін Ґрипхуком, що чекав біля дверей. -- Ви ставите під
сумнів чесність Ґрінґотсу, містере Поттер-Еванс-Веррес?

// 240
//“No,” said Harry absently, “not at all, sorry if that came out wrong, sir. I
//just have no idea at all how your financial system works. I’m asking if
//Galleons in general are made of pure gold.”
-- Ні, -- неуважно сказав Гаррі, -- зовсім ні, вибачте, якщо це погано прозвучало,
сер. Я просто уявлення не маю, як працює ваша фінансова система. Я питаю, чи
ґалеони взагалі роблять з щирого золота.

// 241
//“Of course,” said Griphook.
-- Звісно, -- сказав Ґрипхук.

// 242
//“And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly that thereby
//collects seigniorage?”
-- Їх може карбувати будь-хто, чи їх випускає монополія, що відповідно
отримує сеньйоранж?

// 243
//“What?” said Professor McGonagall.
-- Що? -- сказала професорка Макґонеґел.

// 244
//Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. “Only a fool would trust any but goblin
//coin!”
Ґрипхуком усміхнувся, через що стало видно його гострі зуби.

-- Лише дурні повірять не ґоблінській монеті!

// 245
//“In other words,” Harry said, “the coins aren’t supposed to be worth any more
//than the metal making them up?”
-- Іншими словами, -- сказав Гаррі, -- монети не мають коштувати більше від
металу, з якого вони зроблені?

// 246
//Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked bemused.
Ґрипхук витріщився на Гаррі. Професорка Макґонеґел була приголомшена.

// 247
//“I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I get a ton of
//Sickles made from it?”
-- Тобто, припустімо я прийду сюди з тонною срібла. Чи зможу я отримати тонну
серпиків з неї?

// 248
//“For a fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres.” The goblin watched him with glittering
//eyes. “For a certain fee. Where would you find a ton of silver, I wonder?”
-- За платню, містере Поттер-Еванс-Веррес, -- ґоблін дивився на нього блискучими
очима. -- За певну платню. Цікаво, звідки ви дістанете тонну срібла?

// 249
//“I was speaking hypothetically,” Harry said. __For now, at any rate.__
//“So… how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction of the whole weight?”

// 250
//Griphook’s eyes were intent. “I would have to consult my superiors…”

// 251
//“Give me a wild guess. I won’t hold Gringotts to it.”

// 252
//“A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the coining.”

// 253
//Harry nodded. “Thank you very much, Mr. Griphook.”

// 254
//__So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely decoupled from
//the Muggle economy, no one here has ever heard of arbitrage.__ The larger Muggle
//economy had a fluctuating trading range of gold to silver, so every time the
//Muggle gold-to-silver ratio got more than 5// away from the weight of seventeen
//Sickles to one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the
//wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the exchange rate.
//Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay 5//), change the Sickles
//for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle world, exchange it for more silver
//than you started with, and repeat.

// 255
//Wasn’t the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to one? Harry
//didn’t think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked like the silver coins were
//actually __smaller__ than the gold coins.

// 256
//Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that __literally__ stored your
//money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons, where you had to go in
//and take coins out of your vault whenever you wanted to spend money. The finer
//points of arbitraging away market inefficiencies might well be lost on them.
//He’d been tempted to make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial
//system…

// 257
//__But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.__

// 258
//On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own the whole
//wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this notion in case he ever ran
//out of money, or had a week free.

// 259
//Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault ought to suit
//his near-term requirements.

// 260
//Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with one hand and
//dumping them into the other.

// 261
//When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. “I think that will be
//more than enough to pay for your school supplies, Mr. Potter.”

// 262
//“Hm?” Harry said, his mind elsewhere. “Hold on, I’m doing a Fermi calculation.”

// 263
//“A __what?__” said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat alarmed.

// 264
//“It’s a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough
//numbers quickly in your head…”

// 265
//Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what,
//ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleon would be worth about fifty
//pounds… The mounds of gold coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty
//coins wide in either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it
//would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound,
//roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so forty thousand
//Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.

// 266
//Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was too bad that he
//was right in the middle of discovering the amazing new world of magic, and
//couldn’t take time out to explore the amazing new world of being rich, which a
//quick Fermi estimate said was roughly a billion times less interesting.

// 267
//__Still, that’s the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy pound.__

// 268
//Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. “Pardon me for asking, Professor
//McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were in their twenties when they
//died. Is this a __usual__ amount of money for a young couple to have in
//their vault, in the wizarding world?” If it was, a cup of tea probably cost
//five thousand pounds. Rule one of economics: you can’t eat money.

// 269
//Professor McGonagall shook her head. “Your father was the last heir of an old
//family, Mr. Potter. It’s also possible…” The witch hesitated. “Some of this
//money may be from bounties placed on You-Know-Who, payable to his ki- ah, to
//whoever might defeat him. Or those bounties might not have been collected yet.
//I am not sure.”

// 270
//“Interesting…” Harry said slowly. “So some of this really is, in a sense, mine.
//That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if I don’t remember the
//occasion.” Harry’s fingers tapped against his trouser-leg. “That makes me feel
//less guilty about spending __a very tiny fraction of it! Don’t panic,
//Professor McGonagall!__”

// 271
//“Mr. Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be allowed to make
//__reasonable__ withdrawals from -”

// 272
//“I am __all about__ reasonable! I am totally on board with fiscal prudence
//and impulse control! But I __did __see some things on the way here which
//would constitute __sensible, grown-up__ purchases…”

// 273
//Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a silent staring
//contest.

// 274
//“Like what?” Professor McGonagall said finally.

// 275
//“Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?”

// 276
//Professor McGonagall’s face grew stern. “Those are __very__ expensive, Mr.
//Potter!”

// 277
//“Yes, but -” Harry pleaded. “I’m sure that when I’m an adult I’ll want one. And
//I __can__ afford one. Logically, it would make just as much sense to buy
//it now instead of later, and get the use of it right away. It’s the same money
//either way, right? I mean, I __would__ want a good one, with __lots__
//of room inside, good enough that I wouldn’t have to just get a better one
//later…” Harry trailed off hopefully.

// 278
//Professor McGonagall’s gaze didn’t waver. “And just what would you
//__keep__ in a trunk like that, Mr. Potter -”

// 279
//“Books.”

// 280
//“Of course,” sighed Professor McGonagall.

// 281
//“You should have told me __much earlier __that sort of magic item existed!
//And that I could afford one! Now my father and I are going to have to spend the
//next two days __frantically__ hitting up all the secondhand bookshops for
//old textbooks, so I can have a decent science library with me at Hogwarts - and
//maybe a small science fiction collection, if I can assemble something decent
//out of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I’ll make the deal a little sweeter for
//you, okay? Just let me buy -”

// 282
//“__Mr. Potter!__ You think you can __bribe__ me?”

// 283
//“What? __No!__ Not like that! I’m saying, Hogwarts can keep some of the
//books I bring, if you think that any of them would make good additions to the
//library. I’m going to be getting them cheap, and __I__ just want to have
//them around somewhere or other. It’s okay to bribe people with __books,__
//right? That’s a -”

// 284
//“Family tradition.”

// 285
//“Yes, exactly.”

// 286
//Professor McGonagall’s body seemed to slump, the shoulders lowering within her
//black robes. “I cannot deny the sense of your words, though I much wish I
//could. I will allow you to withdraw an additional hundred Galleons, Mr.
//Potter.” She sighed again. “I __know__ that I shall regret this, and I am
//doing it anyway.”

// 287
//“That’s the spirit! And does a ‘mokeskin pouch’ do what I think it does?”

// 288
//“It can’t do as much as a trunk,” the witch said with visible reluctance, “but…
//a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and Undetectable Extension Charm can
//hold a number of items until they are called forth by the one who emplaced them
//-”

// 289
//“Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the super beltpack
//of ultimate awesomeness! Batman’s utility belt of holding! Never mind my swiss
//army knife, I could carry a whole tool set in there! Or __books!__ I could
//have the top three books I was reading on me at all times, and just pull one
//out anywhere! I’ll never have to waste another minute of my life! What do you
//say, Professor McGonagall? It’s for the sake of children’s reading, the best of
//all possible causes.”

// 290
//“…I suppose you may add another ten Galleons.”

// 291
//Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect, possibly even
//outright admiration.

// 292
//“And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I think I can
//remember seeing one or two other things I might want to store in that pouch.”

// 293
//“__Don’t push it, Mr. Potter.__”

// 294
//“But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely this is a
//__happy__ day, when I discover all things wizarding for the first time!
//Why act the part of the grumpy grownup when instead you could smile and
//remember your own innocent childhood, watching the look of delight upon my
//young face as I buy a few toys using an insignificant fraction of the wealth
//that I earned by defeating the most terrible wizard Britain has ever known, not
//that I’m accusing you of being ungrateful or anything, but still, what are a
//few toys compared to that?”

// 295
//“__You,__” growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look on her face so
//fearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and stepped back, knocking over a
//pile of gold coins with a great jingling noise and sprawling backwards into a
//heap of money. Griphook sighed and put a palm over his face. “I would be doing
//a great service to wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, if I locked you in this vault
//and left you here.”

// 296
//And they left without any more trouble.
